# bikeStabilizer

This project used an MPU-6050 sensor to act as a safety measure in the use of a dirt bike. The sensor is used to constantly monitor the acceleration and roll of the dirt bike. If these measurements exceed a threshold set in the program, it immediately outputs an analog signal which is wired to the dirt bike, turning it off.
